# EX 2A BACKTRACKING - RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To implement the Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking and find all possible paths from the start to the destination in a given maze.


## Algorithm
1. Start at the top-left corner (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Check if the current position is valid (inside bounds, open path, and unvisited).
3. Recursively explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current position.
3. If moving in a direction leads to the destination (n-1, n-1), return True; otherwise, backtrack.
4. If the destination is reached, print the path; otherwise, declare that no solution exists.

			if RatMaze(n, maze, move_x, move_y, x_new, y_new, res):
				return True
			res[x_new][y_new] = 0
	return False

	res[0][0] = 1
	move_x = [-1, 1, 0, 0]
	move_y = [0, 0, -1, 1]

			print()
	else:
		print('Solution does not exist')

# EX 2B BACKTRACKING - NQUEEN PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking, which places N queens on an N*N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.


## Algorithm
1. Start with an empty board of size N x N and attempt to place a queen in each column, one by one.
2. For each row in the current column, check if placing a queen is safe (i.e., no queens threaten each other).
3. If the placement is safe, place the queen and move to the next column recursively.
4. If a valid solution is found (all queens placed), return True; otherwise, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next row.
5. If all queens are placed successfully, print the board; if not, print "Solution does not exist."

# EX 2C BACKTRACKING- SUBSET SUM PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To demonstrate that the sum of the subset of a given set is equal to the given sum.


## Algorithm
1. Loop through all possible subset sizes from 0 to n.
2. For each size, generate all combinations (subsets) of that length.
3. Calculate the sum of each subset.
4. If the sum equals the target x, print the subset.
5. 5.Continue checking until all combinations are tested.

## Program:
```
/*

arr=[]
for i in range(0,n):

    arr.append(a)
x = int(input())

# EX 2D BACKTRACKING - GRAPH COLORING PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the Graph Coloring Problem using backtracking

## Algorithm
1. Start with the first vertex and try assigning each of the m colors to it.
2. For each vertex, check if assigning a color is safe (i.e., no adjacent vertex has the same color).
3. If itâ€™s safe, assign the color and recursively try to color the next vertex.
4. If all vertices are colored without conflicts, print the color assignments.
5. If no valid coloring exists, return false.
